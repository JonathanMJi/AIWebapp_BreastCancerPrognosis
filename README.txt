Web App Design 

The CNN model shows convincing result and has high accuracy and is ready to be used as a systematic framework for real time prediction by end users. To make it user friendly, I designed and developed a web application for the predicting breast cancer survival rate using streamlit,  an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science.

1. Create a machine learning model and train it
2. Take the model and dump into h5 (CNN model)  or pickle (classic model) file
3. Build Front end web application using streamlit with side menus
4. Take the inputs from web application, supply to the h5 file, which contains the model , get the output and display on the user interface
